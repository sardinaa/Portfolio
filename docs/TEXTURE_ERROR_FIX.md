# Texture Loading Error Fix

## Issue
The portfolio was throwing a JavaScript error:
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: can't access property "image", texData is undefined
```

## Root Cause
The KTX2 texture loader in `AssetLoader.ts` was configured to load basis transcoder files from a local path `/basis/` that didn't exist in the public directory. This caused texture loading to fail when processing compressed textures within GLTF models.

## Solution
Updated the KTX2 loader configuration in `src/systems/AssetLoader.ts`:

### Before:
```typescript
this.ktx2Loader.setTranscoderPath('/basis/').detectSupport(renderer);
```

### After:
```typescript
this.ktx2Loader.setTranscoderPath('https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/libs/basis/').detectSupport(renderer);
```

## Additional Improvements
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added better validation for texture data and GLTF scene content
2. **Robust HDR Loading**: Added checks for texture.image and texture.image.data before processing
3. **Clear Logging**: Improved console messages for debugging texture loading issues

## Files Modified
- `src/systems/AssetLoader.ts` - Fixed KTX2 loader path and added error handling

## Technical Details
- **KTX2 Format**: A compressed texture format that requires basis transcoder files
- **Basis Transcoder**: WebAssembly files needed to decode KTX2 textures
- **CDN Solution**: Using Three.js CDN ensures the basis files are always available
- **Fallback**: The app gracefully handles missing HDR environments and texture errors

## Result
- ✅ Texture loading errors resolved
- ✅ 3D model loading works properly
- ✅ Portfolio loads without JavaScript errors
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for future stability

The portfolio should now load without any texture-related errors while maintaining all functionality.
