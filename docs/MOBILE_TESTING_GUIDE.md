# Mobile and Touch Device Testing Guide

## Quick Test Checklist

### Basic Functionality ✓
1. **App Loads**: 3D scene renders properly on mobile
2. **Touch Controls**: 
   - Single finger drag rotates camera
   - Two finger pinch zooms in/out
   - Two finger drag pans camera
3. **Object Interaction**: Tap objects to focus camera and show interactions
4. **UI Elements**: All buttons are easily tappable (minimum 44px)
5. **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes

### Camera Controls ✓
- **Rotation**: Smooth single-finger rotation around the scene
- **Zoom**: Pinch gesture for zooming in and out
- **Pan**: Two-finger panning to move around
- **Focus Targets**: Tap objects to smoothly transition camera focus
- **Free Camera**: Camera movement constraints work on touch

### Performance ✓
- **Frame Rate**: Smooth 60fps or close to it during interactions
- **Touch Response**: Immediate response to touch input
- **Animation**: Smooth camera transitions between targets
- **Loading**: Fast initial load and asset loading

### Mobile Browser Features ✓
- **No Zoom**: Page doesn't zoom when double-tapping
- **No Pull-to-Refresh**: Disabled interfering browser gestures
- **Orientation**: Works in both portrait and landscape
- **Viewport**: Proper full-screen rendering on mobile

## How to Test

### On Desktop (Browser Dev Tools)
1. Open Chrome/Firefox Developer Tools
2. Click mobile device emulation
3. Select iPhone/Android device
4. Test touch interactions with mouse

### On Actual Mobile Device
1. Connect mobile device to same network as development server
2. Visit `http://[YOUR_LOCAL_IP]:5173/` (replace with your computer's IP)
3. Test all touch interactions
4. Rotate device to test orientation changes

### Testing Different Devices
- **Small Phones** (≤ 480px): iPhone SE, small Android
- **Large Phones** (480-768px): iPhone 14, Samsung Galaxy
- **Tablets** (768-1024px): iPad, Android tablets
- **Touch Laptops** (>1024px): Surface devices, touch laptops

## Common Issues to Check

### Touch Not Working
- Verify OrbitControls touch configuration
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Ensure touch event listeners are properly bound

### Poor Performance
- Check device GPU capabilities
- Verify pixel ratio settings
- Monitor frame rate during interactions

### UI Too Small
- Verify touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
- Check responsive CSS media queries
- Test button accessibility

### Gestures Interfering
- Ensure pull-to-refresh is disabled
- Verify zoom gestures are prevented
- Check for proper touch-action CSS properties

## Browser-Specific Notes

### iOS Safari
- Requires `touch-action` CSS properties
- Viewport meta tag configuration is critical
- May need additional preventDefault calls

### Chrome Mobile
- Generally best performance
- Good standards compliance
- Works well with OrbitControls

### Firefox Mobile
- Slightly different touch behavior
- May need gesture event polyfills
- Test zoom and pan sensitivity

### Samsung Internet
- Often includes additional gesture features
- May need specific optimizations
- Test on actual Samsung devices

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance
- **Frame Rate**: ≥30fps consistent, 60fps preferred
- **Touch Response**: <16ms input lag
- **Load Time**: <3 seconds on 4G
- **Memory Usage**: <200MB on mid-range devices

### Optimization Techniques Applied
- Adaptive pixel ratio based on device
- Optimized shadow quality for mobile
- Reduced hover effects on touch devices
- Efficient event handling and cleanup

The application should provide a smooth, native-feeling experience on all modern mobile devices and tablets.
